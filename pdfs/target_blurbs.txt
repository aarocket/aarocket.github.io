Wingless dragons, hideous monsters, extradimensional shadow creatures, this Target has everything. <ins>TARGET.</ins> is the story of a 
24-hour Target store that gets weird in the early morning hours. Our narrator is forced to overcome these otherworldly
threats and more to recover the ultimate prize: 2 pints of ice cream. I wrote <ins>TARGET.</ins> during a late night in Summer 2017 because
I was fed up with my main writing project. Instead of trying to write something good, I resolved to write to have fun and
this was the result. It was supposed to be a one-off, but I liked it so much I kept going. <br>

A UFO descends upon the planet and abducts our narrator. A consortium of aliens conspires to pilfer
the Earth for her resources. Can the narrator escape their clutches and save the world?

In an alternate universe, ducks have overrun the Earth and taken the reigns of society from humanity. A lowly man uses dark magic
to summon an ally in his quest to reinstate the natural order. Now, the only way back home for our narrator is through the
leader of this new regime, the Duck God.

Target IV & V, coming soon...: Steven and the narrator find a spacetime rift in the back of their closet.
